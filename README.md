To do run in project directory:

Run project from directory

```run: npm run build```
```run: cd build```
```run: npm i -g surge```
```run: surge```

** UPDATE: If you're having trouble deploying to Heroku, then use this

#### Surge Link:  https://surge.sh/

#### Heroku Link: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps

The update specifies the Node.js version in the package.json file so that Heroku builds your app correctly.

If you want to fix your own app quickly, simply add this to your package.json file:

 ```"engines": {

  "node": "8.11.1"

 },```

Then re-deploy to Heroku!

If you get an error in your browser, simply wait for your app to "wake up", and then refresh the page
